The
\fBzip_source_stat\fR()
function obtains information about the zip source
\fIsource\fR

The
\fIsb\fR
argument is a pointer to a
\fIstruct zip_source_stat\fR
(shown below), into which information about the zip source is placed.

The structure pointed to by
\fIsb\fR
must be initialized with
\fBzip_stat_init\fR(\fI3\fR)
before calling
\fBzip_source_stat\fR().
.PP
The
\fIvalid\fR
field of the structure specifies which other fields are valid.
Check if the flag defined by the following defines are in
\fIvalid\fR
before accessing the fields:

\fINOTE\fR:
Some fields may only be filled out after all data has been read from
the source, for example the
\fIcrc\fR
or
\fIsize\fR
fields.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
\fIsource\fR
is set to indicate the error.
