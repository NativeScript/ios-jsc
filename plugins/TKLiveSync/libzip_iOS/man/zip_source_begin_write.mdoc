.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_source_begin_write ,
.Nm zip_source_begin_write_cloning
.Nd prepare zip source for writing
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_source_begin_write "zip_source_t *source"
.Ft int
.Fn zip_source_begin_write_cloning "zip_source_t *source" "zip_uint64_t offset"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn zip_source_begin_write
and
.Fn zip_source_begin_write_cloning
prepare
.Fa source
for writing.
Usually this involves creating temporary files or allocating buffers.
.Pp
.Fn zip_source_begin_write_cloning
preserves the first
.Ar offset
bytes of the original file.
This is done efficiently, and writes to
.Ar source
won't overwrite the original data until
.Fn zip_commit_write
is called.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
.Ar source
is set to indicate the error.
