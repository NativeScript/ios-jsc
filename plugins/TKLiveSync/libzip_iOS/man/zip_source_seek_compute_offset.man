.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Use this function to compute the offset for a
\fRZIP_SOURCE_SEEK\fR
or
\fRZIP_SOURCE_SEEK_WRITE\fR
command.
\fIdata\fR
and
\fIdata_length\fR
are the arguments to the source callback,
\fIoffset\fR
is the current offset and
\fIlength\fR
is the length of the source data or, for
\fRZIP_SOURCE_SEEK_WRITE\fR,
the amount of data written.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
On success, it returns the new offset, on error it returns \-1 and
sets
\fIerror\fR.
.SH "ERRORS"
\fBzip_source_seek_compute_offset\fR()
fails if:
.TP 19n
[\fRZIP_ER_INVAL\fR]
One of the arguments is invalid or the seek would place the offset
outside the data.

.SH "HISTORY"
\fBzip_source_seek_compute_offset\fR()
was added in libzip 1.0.
