\fIlen\fR
bytes from the buffer

\fIsource\fR
has to be prepared for writing by calling
zip_source_begin_write(3)
first.
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion the number of bytes written is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
\fIsource\fR
is set to indicate the error.
