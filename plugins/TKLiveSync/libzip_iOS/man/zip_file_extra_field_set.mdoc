.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_file_extra_field_set
.Nd set extra field for file in zip
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_file_extra_field_set "zip_t *archive" "zip_uint64_t index" "zip_uint16_t extra_field_id" "zip_uint16_t extra_field_index" "const zip_uint8_t *extra_field_data" "zip_uint16_t len" "zip_flags_t flags"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_file_extra_field_set
function sets the extra field with ID (two-byte signature)
.Ar extra_field_id
and index
.Ar extra_field_index
for the file at position
.Ar index
in the zip archive.
The extra field's data will be set to
.Ar extra_field_data
and length
.Ar len .
If a new entry shall be appended, set
.Ar extra_field_index
to
.Dv ZIP_EXTRA_FIELD_NEW .
.Pp
At least one of the following
.Ar flags
must be set:
.Bl -tag -width ZIP_FL_CENTRALXX -offset indent
.It Dv ZIP_FL_CENTRAL
Set extra field in the archive's central directory.
.It Dv ZIP_FL_LOCAL
Set extra field in the local file headers.
.El
.Pp
Please note that the extra field IDs 0x0001 (ZIP64 extension),
0x6375 (Infozip UTF-8 comment), and
0x7075 (Infozip UTF-8 file name) can not be set using
.Fn zip_file_extra_field_set
since they are set by
.Xr libzip 3
automatically when needed.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error code in
.Ar archive
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn zip_file_extra_field_set
fails if:
.Bl -tag -width Er
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_INVAL
The extra field size is too large (ID and length need 4 bytes; the
maximum length of all extra fields for one file combined is 65536
bytes).
This error also occurs if
.Ar extra_field_index
is too large.
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_MEMORY
Required memory could not be allocated.
.It Bq Er ZIP_ER_NOENT
.Ar index
is not a valid file index in
.Ar archive .
