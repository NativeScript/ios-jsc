.In zip.h
.Ft zip_source_t *
.Fn zip_source_win32a "zip_t *archive" "const char *fname" "zip_uint64_t start" "zip_int64_t len"

.Sh DESCRIPTION
The functions
.Fn zip_source_win32a
and
.Fn zip_source_win32a_create
create a zip source on Windows using a Windows ANSI name.
They open
.Ar fname
and read
.Ar len
bytes from offset
.Ar start
from it.
If
.Ar len
is 0 or \-1, the whole file (starting from
.Ar start )
is used.
.Pp
If the file supports seek, the source can be used to open a zip archive from.
.Pp
The file is opened and read when the data from the source is used, usually by
.Fn zip_close
or
.Fn zip_open_from_source .
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion, the created source is returned.
Otherwise,
.Dv NULL
is returned and the error code in
.Ar archive
or
.Ar error
is set to indicate the error.
.Sh ERRORS
.Fn zip_source_win32a
and
.Fn zip_source_win32a_create
fail if:
