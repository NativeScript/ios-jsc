.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The function
\fBzip_source_seek\fR()
sets the current read offset for
\fIsource\fR.
Just like in
fseek(3),
depending on the
\fIwhence\fR
argument, the
\fIoffset\fR
is counted relative from:
.RS 6n
.TP 12n
\fRSEEK_SET\fR
start of file
.TP 12n
\fRSEEK_CUR\fR
current read offset in file
.TP 12n
\fRSEEK_END\fR
end of file
.RE
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
\fIsource\fR
is set to indicate the error.
