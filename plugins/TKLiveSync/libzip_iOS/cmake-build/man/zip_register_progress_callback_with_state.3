.Sh NAME
.Nm zip_register_progress_callback_with_state
.Nd provide updates during zip_close
.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Vt typedef void (*zip_progress_callback)(zip_t *, double, void *);
.Ft void
.Fn zip_register_progress_callback_with_state "zip_t *archive" "double precision" "zip_progress_callback callback" "void (*ud_free)(void *)" "void *ud"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_register_progress_callback_with_state
function registers a callback function
.Ar callback
for the zip archive
.Ar archive .
The
.Ar precision
argument is a double in the range from 0.00 to 1.0 that defines the
smallest change for which the callback should be called (to avoid too
frequent calls).
The
.Ar ud_free
function is called during cleanup for deleting the userdata supplied in
.Ar ud .
.Pp
The callback function is called during
.Xr zip_close 3
in regular intervals (after every zip archive entry that's completely
written to disk, and while writing data for entries) with zip archive
.Ar archive ,
the current progression state as a
.Vt double ,
and the user-provided user-data
.Ar ud
as arguments.
The progression state is a
.Vt double
in the range from 0.0 to 1.0.
This can be used to provide progress indicators for user interfaces.
