.Sh LIBRARY
libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Ft int
.Fn zip_source_stat "zip_source_t *source" "zip_stat_t *sb"
.Sh DESCRIPTION
The
.Fn zip_source_stat
function obtains information about the zip source
.Ar source
.Pp
The
.Ar sb
argument is a pointer to a
.Ft struct zip_source_stat
(shown below), into which information about the zip source is placed.
.Bd -literal
struct zip_source_stat {
    zip_uint64_t valid;                 /* which fields have valid values */
    const char *name;                   /* name of the file */
    zip_uint64_t index;                 /* index within archive */
    zip_uint64_t size;                  /* size of file (uncompressed) */
    zip_uint64_t comp_size;             /* size of file (compressed) */
    time_t mtime;                       /* modification time */
    zip_uint32_t crc;                   /* crc of file data */
    zip_uint16_t comp_method;           /* compression method used */
    zip_uint16_t encryption_method;     /* encryption method used */
    zip_uint32_t flags;                 /* reserved for future use */
};
.Ed
The structure pointed to by
.Ar sb
must be initialized with
.Fn zip_stat_init 3
before calling
.Fn zip_source_stat .
.Pp
The
.Ar valid
field of the structure specifies which other fields are valid.
Check if the flag defined by the following defines are in
.Ar valid
before accessing the fields:
.Bl -tag -width ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_ENCRYPTION_METHODXX -compact -offset indent
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_NAME
.Ar name
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_INDEX
.Ar index
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_SIZE
.Ar size
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_COMP_SIZE
.Ar comp_size
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_MTIME
.Ar mtime
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_CRC
.Ar crc
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_COMP_METHOD
.Ar comp_method
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_ENCRYPTION_METHOD
.Ar encryption_method
.It Dv ZIP_SOURCE_STAT_FLAGS
.Ar flags
.El
.Pp
.Em NOTE :
Some fields may only be filled out after all data has been read from
the source, for example the
.Ar crc
or
.Ar size
fields.
.Sh RETURN VALUES
Upon successful completion 0 is returned.
Otherwise, \-1 is returned and the error information in
.Ar source
is set to indicate the error.
