libzip (-lzip)
.Sh SYNOPSIS
.In zip.h
.Vt zip_source_t *zs ;
.Sh DESCRIPTION
A
.Vt struct zip_source
is a data source used by
.Xr libzip 3
for adding or replacing file contents for a file in a zip archive.
If the source supports seeking, it can also be used to open zip archives from.
It is created by calling one of
.Xr zip_source_buffer 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_buffer_create 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_file 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_file_create 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_filep 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_filep_create 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_function 3 ,
.Xr zip_source_function_create 3 ,
or
.Xr zip_source_zip 3 .
.Vt zip_source_t
is reference counted, and created with a reference count of 1.
.Xr zip_open_from_source 3 ,
.Xr zip_file_add 3 ,
and
.Xr zip_file_replace 3
will decrement the reference count of the
.Vt zip_source_t
when they are done using it, so
.Xr zip_source_free 3
only needs to be called when these functions return an error.
Use
.Xr zip_source_keep 3
to increase the reference count, for example if you need the source after
.Xr zip_close 3 .
